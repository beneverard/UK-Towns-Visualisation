# UK-Towns-Visualisation
A visualisation of UK towns using Processing

This app takes a JSON file of UK towns and cities, with population, longitude and latitude values and outputs them on a canvas.

## Current Issues

- Doesn't differentiate by population (colour or size)
- Doesn't use the Mercator projection like Google Maps
